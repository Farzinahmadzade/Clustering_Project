In this project, we want to divide customers into different categories. The characteristics of the data that we have are as follows. And that we use and test all clustering algorithms to improve our algorithm.

1. User ID (CustomerID)
2. Gender of the user
3. Age of the user
4. Annual Income
5. User score based on behavior (Spending Score)
